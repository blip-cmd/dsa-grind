The Sliding Window Deep DiveMy focus has been the Sliding Window pattern. After 10 days of consistent interaction and deep logic checks, I’ve distilled the "secret sauce" into this blueprint.The Two Styles of LogicFeatureFixed WindowVariable WindowGoalExamine each segment of constant size KFind the best segment that meets a conditionExpansionShift window by moving right by 1Move right until the condition is metContractionShift window by closing left by 1Slide left until condition is brokenAha! MomentReuse results like sum/countOnly shrink when you absolutely have toThe Sliding Window BlueprintThe Counter: We use a HashMap for $O(1)$ access. By only updating as pointers move, we maintain $O(N)$ efficiency.The Expansion: The right pointer is the "explorer." It brings in new data. Update state first, then check validity.The Contraction: The left pointer is the "enforcer." It only moves when a rule is broken to restore a valid state.The Global Result: * Max Problems: Update after the while loop (cleanest valid state).Min Problems: Update inside the while loop (trying to find the smallest valid slice).The Simple Sauce FrameworkAsk three questions for any new state logic:What is the Unit of Progress? (e.g., window_counts[char] == target_counts[char])What is the Requirement Count? (e.g., need = len(target_counts))Does Have go up or down? (Up when met, down when broken).Reflection: Battle Scars and Pro-Tips✨ Insight: The Power of the While LoopIn variable windows, the while loop is your best friend. Unlike an if statement, it ensures the window fully "resets" to a valid state before you move on, which is essential for accuracy in complex constraints.✨ Insight: The Off-By-One TrapPython’s exclusive slicing can be a headache. I learned that while the window size is right - left + 1 (inclusive), slicing with s[left:right] excludes the character at the right index. Always verify your bounds to ensure you aren't dropping data.✨ Insight: Clean State ManagementIn Python, a dictionary key with a value of 0 still exists. To keep len(char_counts) accurate, you must explicitly del the key once its count hits zero.
